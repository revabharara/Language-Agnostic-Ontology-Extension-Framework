# 🕹️ Language Agnostic Ontology Extension Framework

🌐 **Synergizing Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs:**

In this project we seamlessly integrate ontologies, offering a structured schema for knowledge organization, with knowledge graphs, enabling semantic, graph-based data analysis. Nodes represent entities, edges depict relationships, and attributes showcase properties in a powerful symbiotic relationship.

🚀 **Dynamic Language-Independent Ontology Generation:**

Our system extracts key concepts and relationships from plain text, building a knowledge graph that captures the essence of a topic. This graph is then transformed into a concept-level modeling graph, utilizing an ID-based approach for concept representation. This data-powered approach transcends language limitations, paving the way for truly universal knowledge representation. ️➡️♾️

* ***This is a group project made during  internship at AICOE JIO by  Reva Bharara and Aryan Rathore*** under the careful guidance of our mentor ***Mr. Krishna Kumar Tiwari (head of knowledge graph platform at AICOE JIO platforms limited)***
* *This project is proof of concept and is at a prototyping phase*

## ❓Need of the application
🔗 **Bridging gap between Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs:**

Traditional ontologies offer a sturdy blueprint, but they're manual, domain-specific, and language-dependent. Our model intervenes by introducing a data-driven approach, automatically constructing knowledge graphs from text and extracting key concepts to create a language-agnostic ontology.

🗝️ **Key features**
* ***Concept-level Modeling from Text:*** We move beyond just keywords and entities, capturing the essence of what matters - the underlying concepts and their relationships.
* ***Automatic and Data-Driven:*** We eliminate the need for manual labor and domain expertise, allowing ontologies to adapt and evolve organically with new data.
* ***Language Independence:*** By employing mathematical representations and translation APIs, our model breaks free from language barriers, making the resulting ontology truly universal.
